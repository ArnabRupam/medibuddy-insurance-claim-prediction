# 🩺 ML Project: Predicting Health Insurance Charges 

The goal of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model that estimates **health insurance charges** based on user demographics and lifestyle features.

In addition to model building, extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visual reporting have been done to understand cost-driving factors. The model helps forecast costs, optimize pricing, and guide policy decisions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The healthcare and insurance industry needs a reliable way to **predict medical insurance costs**. Accurate cost prediction helps:

- Insurance companies in premium setting and customer segmentation  
- Customers understand the factors affecting their premium  
- To enhance personalization in its service offerings  

We aim to build a machine learning model to predict `charges in INR` using features such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- BMI  
- Number of Children  
- Smoking Status  
- Region  
- BMI Category  
- Age Group

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the model, we conducted a thorough EDA using **Excel** and **Python**, which included:

- Distribution of charges across age groups and BMI categories  
- Relationship between smoking habits and costs  
- Average charges per region and sex  

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

### ✅ Step 1: Data Preparation
- Loaded dataset from `Machine_Learning_Dataset.xlsx`  
- Dropped `Policy no.` (an identifier)  
- Defined `charges in INR` as the target variable  
- Separated numerical and categorical features  

### ✅ Step 2: Preprocessing Pipeline
- Used `StandardScaler` for numerical features  
- Used `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features  
- Built a preprocessing pipeline using `ColumnTransformer`  

### ✅ Step 3: Model Building
- Algorithm: **Random Forest Regressor**  
- Tuned hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation  
- Pipeline included both preprocessing and model training  

### ✅ Step 4: Model Evaluation

| Metric     | Value       |
|------------|-------------|
| MAE        | 2530.88     |
| RMSE       | 4501.17     |
| R² Score   | 0.8695      |

### ✅ Step 5: Model Export
- Saved trained model as a `.pkl` file using `joblib`
- location: /models/best_model.pkl
